            <h2>Why Seoul?</h2>
            <h3>Seoul, the city that never sleeps</h3>
            <p>
              The city's metro area is home to roughly 20 million residents,
              whose penchant for working long hours has helped transform the
              country into an economic power in the last half-century. When the
              capital city's residents need a break, there's a host of options
              open to them. Seoul is bursting with cultural events, a buzzing
              nightlife and lively eating spots. The once-grim industrial
              megacity is looking towards the future -- an ambitious urban
              regeneration drive has helped it earn the designation of World
              Design Capital this year -- but the rich cultural heritage of its
              past is also at your fingertips.
